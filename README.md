## Hi there ðŸ‘‹ My name is Andrew Levinton and I am a Mathematics Teacher who is transitioning to Data Science. My passions involve using the vast levels of unstructured data in this world to answer complex questions. I believe there is always a more efficient, and potentially transformative solution to our world's issues, no matter how big they may seem.
