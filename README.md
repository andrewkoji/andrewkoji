## Hi there ðŸ‘‹ My name is Andrew Levinton and I am a Mathematics Teacher who is transitioning to Data Science. My passions involve using the vast levels of unstructured data in this world to answer complex questions. I believe there is always a more efficient, and potentially transformative solution to our world's issues, no matter how big they may seem. 

- ðŸ”­ **Iâ€™m currently working on** using the most advanced AI techniques to solve problems in the field of education. Education, particularly K-12, has many outdated practices that need revitalization. Time for educators is so precious, and the feeling of always needing to do more never leaves their mind. I look to create solutions for educators that will help them to put their "best self" forward, as well as enable them to provide the most fufilling educational experience for their students.
- **A skill that I am currently learning** is developing custom APIs that I can utilize for deploying my projects in the cloud. I just created my first toy API using Flask, Flasgger and it currently just manipulates text and utilizes the openai api for a chatbot. More to come on it later, but feel free to check it out in my repo called "first_api"!
- ðŸ‘¯ **Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on** using Gen AI and techniques like RAG(Retrieval Augmented Generation) to create applications that will solve complex problems in the business and education space. My current focus is to learn more about the use of the AI space and best practices for evaluation of their effectiveness.
